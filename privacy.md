Certain aspects of the Brushfire website are operated on behalf of the clients ("Clients") who pay to use our event management and ecommerce service. Any information we collect from you on their behalf, including but not limited to your personal information and checkout information (excluding sensitive payment information), is the rightful property of Brushfire and that Client. The use of that data by that Client is not governed by this Privacy Policy, but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "Brushfire" include Brushfire, its Clients, and all pages contained within the brushfireapp.com domain. The Brushfire website is a event management and ecommerce site. By using the Brushfire website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
 
### Collection of your Personal Information

If you purchase products and/or services through our website, we collect billing and credit card information. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction. Brushfire may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age and gender. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.
 
Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Brushfire. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Brushfire website.
 
Brushfire encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Brushfire so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Brushfire is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Brushfire website.
 
### Use of your Personal Information

Brushfire collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.  
 
Brushfire may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Brushfire and its affiliates. Brushfire may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
 
Brushfire does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Our Clients have access only to the data collected on the portion of the site/service that they manage.
 
Brushfire will not contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. Your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is never released to external third parties.
 
Brushfire may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Brushfire, in order to determine what Brushfire services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Brushfire to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

### Use of Cookies

The Brushfire website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
 
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Brushfire pages, or register with Brushfire site or services, a cookie helps Brushfire to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Brushfire website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Brushfire features that you customized.
 
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Brushfire services or websites you visit.
 
### Security of your Personal Information

To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Brushfire partners with DigiCert, Inc. to ensure that all pages are protected through the use of encryption and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
 
### Children Under Thirteen

Brushfire does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website.
 
### Disconnecting your Brushfire Account from Third Party Websites

You will be able to connect your Brushfire account to third party accounts (for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and common Church Management Software services). BY CONNECTING YOUR BRUSHFIRE ACCOUNT TO YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUOUS RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO OTHERS (IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON THOSE THIRD PARTY SITES). IF YOU DO NOT WANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, TO BE SHARED INTHIS MANNER, DO NOT USE THE THIS FEATURE. You may disconnect your account from a third party account at any time. Users may disconnect their accounts from third-party websites by visiting their "Profile" page.
