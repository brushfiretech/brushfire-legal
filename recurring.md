## Automatic Recurring Billing Agreement

Automatic Recurring Billing Agreement between Brushfire ("Brushfire") and the organization using Brushfire ("Your Organization") including the person acting as the owner ("You") for Your Organization and/or the person acting as the billing contact ("Billing Contact") for Your Organization.

Please read this agreement carefully and in full before agreeing to create an account for Your Organization and authorize recurring payments. Please verify that all information provided is complete and accurate before confirming Your agreement.

### Billing Terms and Terms of Use

The guidelines by which Brushfire calculates its fees is outlined in the Billing Terms available at [https://brushfire.com/legal](https://brushfire.com/legal). By entering into this agreement, you also agree to the Billing Terms in their entirety. This document is also pursuant to all of the Terms of Use of Brushfire as outlined at [https://brushfire.com/legal](https://brushfire.com/legal).

### Frequency of Payments

All plans are billed monthly ("Period"), on the first day of the Period for the upcoming Period. The first period begins upon creation of the account and will include any applicable one-time fees as well as pre-payment of the first Period's service. You and the Billing Contact will receive a confirmation email at the conclusion of each Period at the email address specified for each of you. You will not receive any advance notice of a payment but You and the Billing Contact will receive post-payment confirmation by email. You and the Billing Contact will also receive confirmation by email if there is no balance or a negative balance on the account at the conclusion of each period.

At the beginning of each Period, payment will be charged for the upcoming Period's service as well as any usage charges incurred during the previous Period. Usage charges are billed according to the parameters specified for each event or store on the date and time that the payment is charged.

### Payment Methods

Brushfire supports payment via three methods: Credit/Debit Card, ACH (Direct Debit), or traditional invoice. Recurring credit/debit card payments are processed securely through a partnership with Stripe ([https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)). ACH (Direct Debit) payments are processed securely through a partnership with Dwolla ([https://dwolla.com](https://dwolla.com)). Credit/Debit Card and ACH payments are processed automatically as described in the "Frequency of Payments" section. Traditional invoices are sent on the first day of the period as if they were processed automatically. Invoices are due upon receipt and should be paid by check addressed to the Brushfire as described at the top of the invoice. 

By entering or changing your payment method's information on Your Organization's Billing page, you are authorizing Brushfire to process payment each period as outlined elsewhere in this document. Payment methods can be changed at any time from Your Organization's Billing page.  Brushfire may, at its sole discretion, choose to limit Your Organization's options for payment methods to any subset of the three total methods.

### Automatic Recurring Payment Failure

Payment will be retried according to the following schedule at the beginning of each period: Five (5) days after first failure, five (5) days after the second failure, and then five (5) days after the third failure. If Your automatic recurring payment is declined or fails for any reason on the fourth and final attempt, You and the Billing Contact will be contacted via email at the address provided for your organization and Your Organization's account will be closed and deactivated so that no further activity or sales can occur from within Brushfire. You may log in at any time prior to your account being deactivated to correct or change the payment information on the Organization Billing Page. Upon correcting the payment information, the previously failed payment amount will be re-attempted, but future Periodic billing dates will not change from their originally scheduled cycle.

### Cancellation of Account and Automatic Recurring Payment

You have the right to change Your payment method or withdraw Your consent to this Automatic Recurring Payment at any time. Doing so will cancel and deactivate Your Organization's account from all use. You will be logged out and all other user accounts will be prevented from logging in. To cancel Your Organization's account at any time, visit Your Organization's Billing Page in Brushfire and select the option to cancel Your Organization's account. Your request to cancel Your Organization's account will be processed immediately but no charges will be refunded and any overages or other charges incurred up to the point of cancellation will be charged to the currently selected payment method at that time. No refunds for negative balances will be issued.

### Re-establishing Account and Automatic Recurring Payment

You may reopen Your account at any time by contacting Brushfire customer service at help@brushfire.com. At this point, Your Organization's account will be reactivated and a new billing cycle will be established. You will be billed any applicable one-time fees as well as the first Period's pre-payment for that Period (often no charge). Billing will continue under the guidelines described above just as if a new account had been created.

### Changing Payment Method for Automatic Recurring Payment

If You would like to change Your payment method, You may do so at any time on Your Organization's Billing page in Brushfire. The change will be processed immediately and any future payments will be charged to the updated payment method. If there were pending/failed charges on the old payment method, they will now be immediately charged to the new payment method.

### Changing Plan and Automatic Recurring Payment

You may change plans up (upgrade) or down (downgrade) to any other available plan at any time from Your Organization's Billing page within Brushfire. All plan changes happen immediately and take effect immediately and are retroactive to the beginning of the current Period, therefore any overages will be calculated at the end of the current Period based upon the parameters of the newly selected plan. Any increases or decreases in charges will be incremental based upon the difference in the newly selected plan and the previously selected plan. No refunds will actually be issued to the specified Payment Method in the case of a credit. Any negative balances will be carried forward to the next Period and applied to the next Period's invoice total.
